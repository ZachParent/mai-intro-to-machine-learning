\subsection{Clustering with reduction vs without}
\label{subsec:clustering-with-reduction-vs-without}

This section analyses the performance of the clustering algorithms with and without reductions of the feature space.
As mentioned previously in the report, the reductions of the feature space is done by applying different
implementations of PCA. The PCA implementations are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item PCA via SKLearn
    \item Our own implementation of PCA
    \item Kernel PCA via SKLearn
\end{itemize}

% Highlight differences in clustering between the PCA implementations and also to no-PCA
% Examine if the PCA implementations are able to reduce the feature space effectively and improve the clustering performance

% Compare if PCA's have impact on accuracy and efficiency

% If possible, show potential impact on runtime and memory usage

% IF SPACE ALLOWS, mention future experiments on parameter tuning for PCA
