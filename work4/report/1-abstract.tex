\paragraph{}
This report presents an investigation into dimensionality reduction techniques 
and their impact on clustering performance, with a particular focus on 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We implement our own PCA algorithm 
and compare it against scikit-learn's implementation, evaluating both 
accuracy and computational efficiency.

\paragraph{}
The study utilizes two distinct datasets (Mushroom and Vowel) to assess 
the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction in conjunction with clustering 
algorithms, specifically Global K-Means and OPTICS. We explore various 
visualization techniques, including PCA and UMAP, to represent high-dimensional 
data in lower-dimensional spaces.

\paragraph{}
Our analysis demonstrates the trade-offs between dimensionality reduction 
and clustering performance, providing insights into optimal configurations 
for different data characteristics. The results show that our PCA implementation 
achieves comparable performance to scikit-learn's version, and that carefully
selecting parameters for each stage of the pipeline can lead to better visualizations.
