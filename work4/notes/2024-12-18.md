## Carlos's conflict

### how it happened
- Carlos began working on OurPCA, but his branch was >20 commits behind main
- when he attempted to push, it failed
- he pulled main and merged, but he merged his changes into main, rather than the other way around
- he did not add a new commit for his merge, so his changes were part of the merge

### what happened
- the history of the repo was changed, showing 20000 lines of code added in a single commit
    - this would make it difficult to see the actual changes made by Carlos
    - this would make it difficult to revert or cherry-pick other commits
- simply reverting this mistake was not possible, since it treated Carlos's chain as the primary parent, and the changes since as the secondary parent

### how it was resolved
- Zach made a new branch from the main including Carlos's changes, to save state
- Zach reverted the merge commit, using the secondary parent as the mainline, using
```zsh
git revert --no-edit 5122152d8147f6f0499d676ba6dfa5362095db27 -m 2
```
- Zach reverted the reversion, with edits, to replay Carlos's actual changes
```zsh
git revert HEAD~1
```
- Zach interactive rebased the branch onto the last good commit, folding up Carlos's changes and the 2 reversions into a single commit "add OurPCA"
```zsh
git rebase -i HEAD~6
```
- Zach force pushed the branch to the remote
```zsh
git push --force-with-lease
```

### learnings
- be sure to pull all changes beginning work
    - this is especially important when you haven't worked on a repo for a while
- if you're working on main and need to catch up to changes, prefer rebasing over merging
```zsh
git pull --rebase
```
- before pushing changes, always review the changelog
```zsh
git show --name-only HEAD
```
- avoid using `git push --force` unless you know what you're doing
    - this can overwrite changes made by others
