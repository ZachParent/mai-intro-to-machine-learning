coding is not too much
### Dim reduction
#### PCA
our own implementation
#### Kernal PCA

### Visualization
#### Use PCA
#### UMAP
library

### evaluate
compare PCA against library PCA output
#### compare clustering without dim reduction
#### compare clustering with dim reduction
use improved Kmeans and optics

#### visualize the clustering
using PCA and UMAP
