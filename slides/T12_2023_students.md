[[bias]] and [[fairness]]
## [[T12_2023_students.pdf#page=6&selection=0,0,4,4|DEFINITION OF BIAS]]
> inclination or prejudice for or **against one person or group**, especially in a way considered to be unfair

## [[T12_2023_students.pdf#page=7&selection=0,0,4,8|DEFINITION OF FAIRNESS]]
> *impartial and just treatment* or behavior without favoritism or discrimination

in the context of machine learning

> An algorithm is fair if it makes predictions that do not favor or discriminate against certain individuals or groups based on sensitive characteristics

> There is a widespread belief that software and algorithms that rely on data are objective
> 
> But software is not free of human influence. Algorithms are written and maintained by people, and machine learning algorithms adjust what they do based on people’s behavior. As a result … algorithms can reinforce human prejudices

**COMPAS** is a decision support tool used by some US justice systems. Judges and parole officers use the system to score criminal defendants likelihood of recidivism (reoffending)

**Black defendants** were predicted as higher risk than they actually were

**White defendants** were predicted as lower risk than they actually were

# exam
includes questionnaire 20-30 questions
similar to quizzes

small question in which you write
never ask about formulas
will not be computing or filling tablers

could be 
> explain how to perform PCA

you would have to explain the process

> how does optics perform clustering

explain it in natural language

we will need to bring our laptops. the open questions will likely be on paper

the questionnaire will probably be on laptops

it will be one section first: probably questionnaire then open ended questions
