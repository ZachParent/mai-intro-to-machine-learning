\subsubsection{Instance Reduction Analysis}
\label{subsubsec:discussion-reduction}

This section interprets the results of the dimensionality reduction techniques, 
discussing their impact on the analysis and visualization.

Figure [INSERT FIGURE REF] shows the results of our analyzis in terms of accuracy, 
training speed and storage reduction capbilities of the instance reduction techniques
 implemented (\textit{i.e.}, GCNN, ENNTH and DROP3)
