\subsubsection{Support Vector Machines (SVM) Analysis}
\label{subsubsec:discussion-svm}

% SVMs performed well on both the hepatitis and the mushroom datasets,
% achieving peak accuracy and F1 scores which match the best results from KNN.

A key advantage of the SVM over KNN is that SVMs are much faster during consultation time. As seen in \autoref{fig:model_comparison_mushroom},
SVMs tend to have much lower test times than KNN. This is expecially noticable for large datasets like the mushroom dataset.

\begin{description}
    \item[\textbf{Best Configuration:}]\leavevmode
        \begin{itemize}
            \item C = 7 with RBF Kernel
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Accuracy: 95.5%

        \end{itemize}

    \label{fig:ranked_folds_svm_hepatitis}
\end{figure}

For the hepatitis dataset, the configuration using the \textbf{RBF} kernel and $C=7$
achieved outstanding accuracy and F1 scores. However, because of the simple predictability
of the mushroom data, the simple \textbf{Polynomial} kernel performed better when paired with $C=1$.
(See \autoref{tab:svm_results_hepatitis} and \autoref{tab:svm_results_mushroom}).

\subsubsection*{Overall Comparison}

To compare the performance across model configurations, we employed statistical analysis methods
(see \autoref{sec:statistical-analysis}) to determine whether the various configurations showed
statistically significant differences in performance.

As seen in \autoref{fig:ranked_folds_svm_hepatitis} and \autoref{fig:ranked_folds_svm_mushroom},
some models achieved significantly better results than others. By comparing the ranks among each of the 10 folds,
we can check to see if there were any cases in which 1 model always outperformed another.

The mushroom dataset has some especially obvious cases, in which the $C=3$ and $C=5$ RBF models
outperformed all other models across every fold. The $C=5$ RBF model was the best performing model overall.

The hepatitis dataset does not have as extreme of a case, but there are still some models that stand out.
The $C=7$ Sigmoid model was consistently worse than the $C=3$ and $C=5$ RBF models.

    \label{fig:nemenyi_test_results_SVM_mushroom}
\end{figure}

To identify significant pairs at a glance, we performed the Nemenyi test on all model pairs,
and present them in heatmaps (see \autoref{fig:nemenyi_test_results_SVM_hepatitis} and \autoref{fig:nemenyi_test_results_SVM_mushroom}).
The cells represent the p-values for each pair of models. A value of 0.05 or lower indicates that the models are statistically different
at the 95\% confidence level. The full tables containing the p-values for each pair of significant models are provided in \autoref{tab:svm_significant_pairs_hepatitis} and \autoref{tab:svm_significant_pairs_mushroom}.

    \label{fig:interaction_effects_SVM_hepatitis}
\end{figure}

To further analyze the hyperparameters we plotted the effects of each hyperparameter on the F1 score.

Here we see that the Kernel Type is a stronger predictor of performance than the $C$ parameter, and that
the best performing models tend to use the poly or linear kernals, and that higher values of $C$ tend to perform worse.
