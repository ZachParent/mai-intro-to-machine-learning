\subsubsection{Support Vector Machines (SVM) Analysis}
\label{subsubsec:discussion-svm}

As seen in \autoref{tab:svm_results_mushroom} and \autoref{tab:svm_results_hepatitis},
SVMs performed well on both the hepatitis and the mushroom datasets,
achieving peak accuracy and F1 scores which match the best results from KNN.

A key advantage of the SVM over KNN is that SVMs are much faster during consultation time
% TODO: Add a table comparing the training and consultation times of SVM and KNN

% TODO: Discuss the impact of different kernel functions and hyperparameters
For both the hepatitis and mushroom datasets, the configuration using RBF kernel and $C=7$
achieved outstanding accuracy and F1 scores. However, because of the simple predictability
of the mushroom data, the simple Polynomial kernel performed just as well when used with $C=1$.
% TODO: Address any unexpected findings or limitations specific to SVM
