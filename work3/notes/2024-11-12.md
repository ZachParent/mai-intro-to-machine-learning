## 2024-11-12 Notes

### Project is due 2024-12-08


* Unsupervised learning
* Clustering
    * Optics <-> using sklearn, same for everyone
    * Spectral clustering <-> using sklearn, same for everyone
    * K means (using our own code)
    * Improved K means (using our own code)
        * 5 or 6 algorithms, select 2 (the difficulty of the algorithm affects the grade)
    * FCM (using your own code)
    * Perform evaluation (using sklearn metrics)

How we choose parameters for Optics and Spectral clustering affects results significantly

Be careful about the time needed to run experiments! Depending on the parameters, the run time may change considerably

Random partition of clusters requires running several times, since it produces different results each time.

### Packages allowed in this exercise:
* arff_loader
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* sklearn (only for some parts)
* matplotlib
* seaborn

### Session 1
* Intro
