## KMeans


## Questions

* should we specifically use accuracy, precision and recall? Is f-measure sufficient?
* we already measure purity, ari, f-measure, DBI and runtime. Do we need to include additional metrics?
   * do you grade more generously if we include additional metrics, such as silhouette score?
* should we include synthetic dataset results for method and metric validation?
